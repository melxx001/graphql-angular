## Installing Apollo

* apollo-client is the Apollo Client library
* apollo-angular contains the bindings to use Apollo Client with Angular.
* graphql-tag is a GraphQL parser. Every GraphQL operation you hand over to Apollo Client will have to be parsed by the gql function.
* apollo-angular-link-http provides a similar HttpLink to Apolloâ€™s HttpLink with one difference, it uses Angularâ€™s HttpClient.
* apollo-cache-inmemory is a cache implementation that supports all of Apollo Client 1.0â€™s features without the dependency on Redux.
* graphql contains Facebookâ€™s reference implementation of GraphQL - Apollo Client uses some of its functionality as well.
